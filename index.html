        <p>
        Plants are a thing that help us alot and 
        <br>
        they get rid of C02 and produce oxygen.
        <br>    
        this soil is moiste enough for the plant to 
        <br>
        take water from the root.    
        </p>

        <p>
        Plants are often moved into pots.
        <br>
        First you take the plant by its roots.
        <br>
        Next you put it in a pot.
        <br>    
        Last you water it!

        <p>
        However not all plants make food like sun and water into sugar,
        <br>    
        they sometimes eat..... bugs? 
        <br>
        Yes they do, there is a plant that eats bugs, that is the venus fly trap!
        <br>    
        They attract bugs into their mouth and trap them and suck their juice yes um juice!
        </p>

        <p>
        But plants and trees too are dying faster than they are planted.
        <br>
        You can help by planting some plants and stop C02.
        <br>
        If we plant trees, then when the trees grow there would be so much C02
        <br>
        that not even a hundred thousand trees could take that C02!
